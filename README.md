What the f\*ck Golang? ðŸ¤¨

### ðŸ”´ `len("string")` is not really length of a string

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Println(len("FÑ–ve"))
}
```

**Output**

```go
5
```

Well, it's obviously 5. Isn't it? ðŸ˜…  
Don't trust me? Run it yourself in [The Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/BUU_QMh6xLl) ðŸ˜œ

#### ðŸ’¡ Explanation

Ok it's 2 AM and I'm going to bed now. I'll update this tomorrow. ðŸ˜´
